How good was the fossil record? Clues from the Californian Pleistocene
 
## Article Summary

This paper by James W. Valentine is a scientific paper on assessing the fossil record quality.

marine benthic communities, which yield our longest and most diverse record of animal life. the composition of the dead assemblages commonly reflects fairly closely the durably skeletonized species that inhabit the environments where they are found, and in some cases rather fine spatial gradients and variations in living associations are mirrored in the dead assemblages

Valentine found that the record has captured all of the important species and species associations, and a very high percentage of all species, important or unimportant, in the families studied. Species-rich accumulations of dead shells, have been captured by the fossil record commonly enough and over wide enough a range of shelf environments to form a surprisingly complete record of the easily fossilized fraction of the living fauna. The completeness of the species pool also implies that the living communities are well represented.

The bulk of the marine invertebrate fossil record the preserved remnants of an excellent original record formed through ordinary though episodic processes. 

He elaborates that the main loss in the numbers of durably skeletonized species that are fossilized does not occur during the incorporation of shells into dead assemblages or even of the dead assemblages into lithologic units as a fossil record, but in destruction of the fossil record itself.

## Things I liked about the paper
      
I like that the paper is easy to read. 

## Things I did not like about the paper

I would like some more figures in the paper because it is quite boringly represented. I would have liked to see some stratigraphic columns to represent some of the data from some of the localities. I do agree with his findings but Valentine only elaborated very briefly on the samples from the localities so I am not very convinced with his writing.  I also think that the map in Figure 1 could hold more data to add more depth and significance to it. It currently only shows the localities mapped on a map without any more additional information.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There is a figure and a table in this paper and they are both fairly simple. The figure is a map of the main localities studied in the paper. It helps to show the relative positions of the localities but could potentially be used to present more information from one figure. The table is a summary of the living pool of molluscan species from the Californian region. It shows higher percentages of genera and families from the living pool that were found as fossils compared to percentages of species. In fact, almost 90% of the families appear in the record.
