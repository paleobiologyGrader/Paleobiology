## Article Summary

This paper by Barnosky et al. reviews how our understanding of today's extinction crisis is influenced by fossil and modern data differences and by updated available palaeontological information.According to Barnosky et al, there is a data disparity in the fossil record since most fossilized taxa are those with fossilizable hard parts and are mainly from temperate latitudes as water is among the essential factors for a high probability of preservation. In estimating fossil species, the 75% benchmark for mass extinction was obtained by calculating the species-to-genus ratio determined for well-known groups, and using this ratio to extrapolate to groups only containing genus-level counts.

Their results confirm that current extinction rates are higher than would be expected from the fossil record, highlighting the need for effective conservation measures.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There are three figures in this paper. Figure 1 shows the relationship between extinction rates and the time interval over which the rates were calculated, for mammals. Figure 2 shows the extinction magnitudes of IUCN-assessed taxa in comparison to the 75% mass-extinction benchmark. Figure 3 shows the extinction rate versus extinction magnitude.
