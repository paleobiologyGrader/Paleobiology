Has the Earth's sixth mas extinction already arrived?
 
## Article Summary

This paper by Barnosky et al. reviews how our understanding of today's extinction crisis is influenced by fossil and modern data differences and by updated available palaeontological information.According to Barnosky et al, there is a data disparity in the fossil record since most fossilized taxa are those with fossilizable hard parts and are mainly from temperate latitudes as water is among the essential factors for a high probability of preservation. They refine percentage losses over different time intervals by compensating for the differences between the modern and the fossil record. In estimating fossil species, the 75% benchmark for mass extinction was obtained by calculating the species-to-genus ratio determined for well-known groups, and used this ratio to extrapolate to groups that only contain genus-level counts. Their results confirm that current extinction rates are higher than would be expected from the fossil record, highlighting the need for effective conservation measures.

## Things I liked about the paper
      
I thought that the topic in general is very interesting and important in today's faunal conservation efforts and in understanding the biodiversity decline as an effect of climate change. I like their assessment of all the Big Five mass extinctions and comparing the extinction rates to modern conditions. It is quite scary to think that organisms are going extinct at an alarming rate and at rates much higher than ever before. I especially like their assessment of various data comparison problems in Box 1. They also explain previous and current data collection methods and how the results can be skewed besides from suggeesting alternatives or ways we can account for those deviations. 

## Things I did not like about the paper

I think that the paper is actually generally okay. I just probably do not really understand the presentation of Figure 1 and why it looks slightly complicated. It is thoroughly explained but has a somewhat windy explanation.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There are three figures in this paper. Figure 1 shows the relationship between extinction rates and the time interval over which the rates were calculated, for mammals. Setting short-interval and long-interval rates in a comparative context verifies the efficacy of E/MSY. Figure 2 shows the extinction magnitudes of IUCN-assessed taxa in comparison to the 75% mass-extinction benchmark. The numbers suggest that the sixth mass extinction has not yet begun but that we would get halfway closer to it, as opposed to a quarterways away, if ‘threatened’ species had disappeared. Figure 3 shows the extinction rate versus extinction magnitude. The dots indicate hypothetical rates of extinction if the extinction interval extended over 500 years.
