## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There are three figures in this paper. Figure 1 shows the relationship between extinction rates and the time interval over which the rates were calculated, for mammals. Figure 2 shows the extinction magnitudes of IUCN-assessed taxa in comparison to the 75% mass-extinction benchmark. Figure 3 shows the extinction rate versus extinction magnitude.
