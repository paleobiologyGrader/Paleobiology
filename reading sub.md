## Article Summary

This paper by Gingerich 
In the Paleocene-Eocene epoch transition, there is an unusual and sudden clustering of Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla and Primates. In addition, these modern orders have early species that are much smaller than their immediate descendants without much explanation prior to the use stable isotopes. Based on abrupt decrease in d18O, in foraminifera carbonate tests, a short 100 000-year warming event was identified as the PETM. 

The study of the PETM is important in considering the causes and effects of global greenhouse warming, and the predictions for today's global warming. In particular, it could start a runaway feedback warming like in the Eocene transition and even cause dwarfing in mammals as a result of methane oxidation. The PETM and associated CIE represent one of many episodic environmental perturbations, that can be explained by Stenseth and Smith's Stationary hyphothesis of episodic evolution. Gingerich thus concluded that global environmental events must be considered in modelling the history of life as they greatly affect evolution in the past. 

## Things I liked about the paper
      
I like that the author put in a lot of background information into the paper which made understanding the topic as a whole easier.
The distribution of tooth sizes through time in Figure 4 was very interesting. I thought that the figure made me convinced of the size change, relating to the dwarfism during the PETM.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There are four figures in this paper. Figure 1 shows the stratigraphic context of Paleocene–Eocene vertebrate faunal change at Polecat Bench and vicinity in the Clarks Fork–Bighorn basins of northwestern
Wyoming, North America. Figure 2 shows the Global distribution of fossil localities contributing to our understanding of environmental and evolutionary change at the Paleocene–Eocene boundary. Figure 3 shows the High-resolution stratigraphic record of benthic marine foraminiferal species (red lines) studied in relation to carbon isotope d13C (blue) during the onset of the Paleocene–Eocene CIE at ODP site 690 in the South Atlantic. Size change and apparent dwarfing in the mammalian genus Ectocion evolving across the Paleocene–Eocene boundary in the Polecat Bench section of Figure 1.
Ectocion parvus was approximately half the weight of typical E. osbornianus.
