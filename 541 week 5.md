## Article Summary

This paper by Osvaldo E. Sala et al. is a review paper highlighting the sensitivity of biodiversity change and represents attempt to develop global biodiversity scenario projections for the future. They also compare the variation of sensitivities in 10 different terrestrial biomes including artic, alpine,grassland, savanna, tropical, and desert environments and in freshwater ecosystems for the year 2100 based on global scenarios of changes in environment and land use. They first identified changes in land use, atmospheric CO2 concentration, nitrogen deposition and acid rain, climate, and biotic exchanges as the main determinants for change in biodiversity. They then calculated In particular, the analysis should be for eventual use by policy-makers. They find that human disturbance accellerate changes in biodiversity. The greatest effect on the composition of species is from elevated CO2 levels. Also, biodiversity is sensitive to environment and land use change in the global scale. They hypothesize that there will be intermediate biodiversity changes between scenarios that consider synergistic interactions or no interactions.

## Things I liked about the paper
      
I like that the paper is easy to read and simple to understand. The figures are also easy to look at and understand. In particular, figures are pleasing the look at and very simplified. The figures are also relevant to the paper and aid in the visualization. I also liked that they reviewed a large variation of biomes so that we could how the changes in biodiversity differ between different environments. It added content to the paper and its arguments. 

## Things I did not like about the paper

The main thing I did not like about the paper is its style of writing that seems to be oversimplifying the issue. I am aware that it is a review paper, but I was not convinced by how it was written. I did not think that the data used was sufficient nor reliable enough. I am not too convinced of the accuracy of the proxies in determining the future projections of land use, climate, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange and the atmospheric CO2.

> Many of your colleagues felt similarly, but you should try to give some more concrete examples. For example, many people complained that the ranking scheme was not clearly explained. Try to use more detail in your criticisms and likes.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There are 3 figures and 4 tables in this paper and they are all fairly simple and easy to read and understand. 

> This is a pretty underwhelming response! You could definitely have gone into more detail about the figures and what they depicted.
