Global Biodiversity Scenarios for the Year 2100.
 
## Article Summary

This paper by Osvaldo E. Sala et al. is a review paper highlighting the sensitivity of biodiversity change and represents attempt to develop global biodiversity scenario projections for the future. They also compare the variation of sensitivities in different biomes including artic, alpine,grassland, savanna, tropical, and desert environments. They also may out the relative biodiversity changes in presenting their arguments. In particular, the analysis will be for eventual use by policy-makers. They find that human disturbance accellerate changes in biodiversity. The greatest effect on the composition of species is from elevated CO2 levels. Also, biodiversity is sensitive to environment and land use change in the global scale. They hypothesize that there will be intermediate biodiversity changes between scenarios that consider synergistic interactions or no interactions.

## Things I liked about the paper
      
I like that the paper is easy to read and simple to understand. The figures are also easy to look at and understand. In particular, figures are pleasing the look at and very simplified. The figures are also relevant to the paper and aid in the visualization.

## Things I did not like about the paper

The main thing I did not like about the paper is its style of writing that seems to be overblowing the issue. I am not convinced by the writing because    

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There are 3 figures and 4 tables in this paper and they are all fairly simple and easy to read and understand.
