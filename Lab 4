Problem Set I

1) How many unique genera are in the Miocene,Early Jurasic,Late Cretaceous, and Pennsylvanian epochs (not total, each)? What code did you use to find out?

2) How many geologic epochs in general are in this dataset? What code did you use to find out?

3) Which epochs contain specimens of the genus Mytilus? What code did you find out.

4) Look at the epochs in the geologic timescale. Using your answer to question 3, in which epochs can we infer that Mytilus was present, even though we have no record of them in the Paleobiology Database? How did you deduce this?

Problem Set II

The Jaccard index is the simplest Similarity index. It is the intersection of two samples divided by the union of two samples. In other words, the number of genera shared between two samples, divided by the total number of (unique) genera in both samples.

1) Using your own custom R code, find the Jaccard similarity of the Pleistocene and Miocene "samples" in your PresencePBDB matrix. It is possible to code this entirely using only functions discussed in the R Tutorial, but here are some additional functions that may be helpful.

2) How can you convert your similarity index into a distance?

3) Install and load the vegan package into R. Read the help file for the vegdist function - ?vegdist or help(vegdist). Again, calculate the jaccard distance of the "Miocene" and "Pleistocene" samples of PresencePBDB, but this time use the vegdist( ) function. This should be an identical answer to what you got in question 2.

4) Using the vegdist( ) function. Calculate the Jaccard distances of all the following epochs in PresencePBDB - the "Pleistocene", "Pliocene", "Miocene", "Oligocene", "Eocene", "Paleocene". What code did you use? Which two epochs are the most dissimilar?
