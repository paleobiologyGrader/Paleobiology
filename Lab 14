I handpicked the top taxon names that actually make sense because the first 20 names were just made up of 2 to 3 letters that don't make a distinguishable taxa name.

+What are the commonly used or colloquial names for these 20 taxa, if any? (Look them up online if you need to.) 

Articulata - brachiopod
Ammonites - molluscs
ostracods - shrimp
gastropods - snails, molluscs

brachiopods
echinoderms

+Which of these are probably not good data? Why? 

The top 20 taxon names were too trauncated so none of them were good data. 

+Conversely, which taxa are likely candidates for pyritization, and why?

ammonites, gastropods, and brachiopods, since they can survive anoxic conditions where pyrite would form.

Step 5


Print your list. Explain why you chose the string you did.

my_taxon_name
ostracod
ammon
trilobit
bryozoa
echino
brachiopod
cephalopod
worm
porifer
coral
annelid
plant
leaf
foram
bivalv
baculit
spong
nannofossil
gastropod
snail

I chose this list because they were more specific portions of words and had more colloquial terms that some authors prefer to use.
