Origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity
 
## Article Summary

This paper by Bambach et al. discusses origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity. They reevaluated the magnitude of extinction to decide whether the events that should be counted as mass extinctions can be connected to an effect or cause. They compare the "big five" events to other extinction intensities, study the role of origination and extinction in diversity changes related to the five intervals, and compare differences and similarities between each of the intervals. They use boundary-crossing standing diversity to represent changes in diversity over time. In this paper, they stress that diversity is a function of origination and extinction. Only the end-Ordovician, end-Permian, and end-Cretaceous are predominantly driven by extinction. Furthermore, they have different patterns of diversity change that show that they do not relate with continuity of effect or cause. 

Bambach et al. concluded that the late Frasnian and the end-Triassic mass depletions mainly resulted from continuous reduction of origination instead of coming from accelerated rates of extinction. The low origination was reflected in the diversity, which seemed particularly severe as these two intervals occurred in a period of generally high extinction. However, three of the five mass depletions can be regarded as "true" global mass extinctions because they resulted from only the unusually high levels of extinction. The end-Ordovician, end-Permian, and end-Cretaceous intervals had statistically different extinction magnitudes compared to the extinction magnitudes in their stratigraphic neighborhoods. 

## Things I liked about the paper
      
I agree with Bambach et al. that the crash of diversity during the late Frasnian and the end-Triassic should not be interpreted as "true" mass extinctions since the two intervals experienced a substantial decrease in origination. It is interesting that diversity plots can hide these other factors and we can easily be mislead to interpreting decreased diversity directly as periods of extinction, if we are not careful. I also thought Raupâ€™s simulations of extinction and poor rock record was interesting. It really shows that missing time does not change apparent fluctuations in diversity. I like that there are a lot of figures in this paper. Although some of them are very similar to each other, like Figure 4 and 6, the first one shows the extinction magnitudes while the latter shows both origination and extinction. It is interesting to see how they relate and differ.

## Things I did not like about the paper

I might have missed it while reading, but I would have liked an explicit definition of what the author think origination is. I think the paper is bit lengthy and unanswered questions such as the cause of the mass extinctions, although this is the nature of most of geology and I understand why, make it difficult to not see some reasoning as speculation. Besides that, in Figure 2, the decision to of make the low point in the Carbonaceous as "background" diversity fluctuation can be questionable since it plots on the lower limit of the range. 

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There are nine figures in this paper. The first figure shows the diversity and diversity turnover of marine genera by interval through the Phanerozoic based on the data in the Sepkoski genus compilation. The second figure is a plot of proportion of gain or loss of genus diversity from the Caradoc to the Plio-Pliestocene. Five points are identified as periods of mass extinction. The low point in the Carbonaceous in the graph is on the border of the range where the diversity can be either be counted as "background" fluctuation in diversity or irregularly high diversity. Figure 3 shows the proportions of genus extinction in increasing order of magnitude. The extinction at the end Permian, end Ordovician and end Triassic is quite clear in the labelled cluster of points. Figure 4A and 4B are correlative with each other and show proportions of genus extinction according to interval in strtigraphic order. The stratigraphic groupings help to visualize and compare between differnt stratigraphic intervals. Figure 5 helps to give a statistical analysis of the post-Arenig extinction magnitudes. Figure 6 illustrates the proportions of both genus origination and extinction through the Phanerozoic, which is a particularly necessary figure for this paper. Figure 7 shows the relationship between origination and extinction for the three mass diversity depletions that are true mass extinctions. Figure 8 shows the relationship between origination and extinction for the Late Frasnian and Late Devonian to further strengthen the argument on these intervals as mass depletion, rather than "true" mass extinctions. Figure 9 shows the genus diversity and diversity turnover through the Cambrian and Early Ordovician.
