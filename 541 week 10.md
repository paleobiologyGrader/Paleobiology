Origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity
 

 
## Article Summary

Low origination contributed more than high extinction to the marked loss of diversity in the late Frasnian and at the end of the Triassic. Therefore, whereas the ‘‘big five’’ events are clearly times when diversity suffered mass depletion, only those at the end of the Ordovician, Permian, and Cretaceous
periods unequivocally qualify as globally distinct mass extinctions

we reevaluate the continuity or discontinuity of magnitude and then briefly consider whether events that
might be regarded as mass extinctions can be unified by effect or cause. We test whether any of the ‘‘big five’’ events are differentiable from the distribution of other extinction intensities, explore the role of origination as well as extinction in diversity changes associated with these five intervals, and comment on the differences, as well as similarities, among the intervals.

Only three were driven predominantly by extinction and even they display distinctly different patterns of diversity change, implying that
these events are not related by continuity of effect or cause

The extinction magnitudes of
these three intervals are statistically different
from the extinction magnitudes in their stratigraphic
neighborhoods; they can be regarded
as ‘‘true’’ global mass extinctions.
