Origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity
 
## Article Summary

This paper by Bambach et al. discusses origination, extinction, and mass depletions of marine diversity. They reevaluated the magnitude of extinction to decide whether the events that should be counted as mass extinctions can be connected to an effect or cause. They compare the "big five" events to other extinction intensities, study the role of origination and extinction in diversity changes related to the five intervals, and compare differences and similarities between each of the intervals. Only the end-Ordovician, end-Permian, and end-Cretaceous are predominantly driven by extinction. Furthermore, they have different patterns of diversity change that show that they do not relate with continuity of effect or cause.

Bambach et al. concluded that the late Frasnian and the end-Triassic mass depletions mainly resulted from continuous reduction of origination instead of coming from accelerated rates of extinction. The low origination was reflected in the diversity, which seemed particularly severe as these two intervals occurred in a period of generally high extinction. However, three of the five mass depletions can be regarded as "true" global mass extinctions because they resulted from only the unusually high levels of extinction. The end-Ordovician, end-Permian, and end-Cretaceous intervals had statistically different extinction magnitudes compared to the extinction magnitudes in their stratigraphic neighborhoods. 

## Things I liked about the paper
      
I agree with Bambach et al. that the crash of diversity during the late Frasnian and the end-Triassic should not be interpreted as "true" mass extinctions since the two intervals experienced a substantial decrease in origination. It is interesting that diversity plots can hide these other factors and we can easily be mislead to interpreting decreased diversity directly as periods of extinction, if we are not careful. I also thought Raupâ€™s simulations of extinction and a poor rock record was interesting. 

## Things I did not like about the paper

I might have missed it while reading, but I would have liked an explicit definition of what the author think origination is. I think the paper is bit lengthy and unanswered questions such as the cause of the mass extinctions, although I understand why, make it difficult to not see some reasoning as speculation. 

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There are nine figures in this paper. The first figure shows the history of marine genus diversity through the Phanerozoic.
