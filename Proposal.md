## Finalized topic and hypothesis

Paleoecology of The Great Barrier Reef: projections of coral diversity and disparity between edge zones and central zones of coral colonies with global warming effects. Edge zones experience limited gene flow and can be responsible for the predominance of evolutionary innovation. The change in environmental conditions could introduce new species into the edge zones as a result of migration, but may also lead to changes in morphological changes due to adaptation. Based on the morphologies of *Pleistocene corals and modern colonies, variation in morphological disparity from the center to the edge of the Great Barrier Reef can be studied. The extent of damage or magnitude of decrease in coral diversity as a result of rising temperatures can also be assessed and compared between these two zones.

corals thrive at the north-easterly point of borneo - clear and pure, swept by fresh winds and always being renewed.
unlike the sunda sea basin where there are no great ocean currents, the water stagnates

Thus, edge zones, which often experience limited gene flow, are responsible for the predominance of evolutionary innovation.
