Determinants of extinction in the fossil record
 
## Article Summary

This paper by Shanan E. Peters and Michael Foote is a scientific paper on the determinants of extinction in the fossil record.


assessing the fossil record quality, in particular, on marine benthic communities. He also discussed the life and death assemblages and its comparison to Pleistocene assemblages. The durably skeletonized species that inhabit the environments where they are found is reflected in the composition of the dead assemblages. In some cases, fine spatial gradients and variations in living associations are represented in the dead assemblages. Valentine found that the record captured all of the important species and species associations, and a very high percentage of all species in the families studied. A quite complete record of the easily fossilized fraction of the living fauna has been formed from the species-rich accumulations of dead shells over a wide range of shelf environments. The completeness of the species pool also implies that the living communities are well represented. The bulk of the marine invertebrate fossil record the preserved remnants of an excellent original record formed through ordinary though episodic processes. Valentine concludes that the main loss in the numbers of fossilized durably skeletonized species occurs during the destruction of the fossil record rather than during the incorporation of shells into dead assemblages or even of the dead assemblages into lithologic units.

## Things I did not like about the paper

I would like some more figures in the paper because it is quite boringly represented. I would have liked to see some stratigraphic columns to represent some of the data from some of the localities. I also think that the map in Figure 1 could hold more data to add more depth and significance to it. It currently only shows the localities mapped on a map without any more additional information.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There are three figures and a table in this paper. 

and they are both fairly simple. The figure is a map of the main localities studied in the paper. It helps to show the relative positions of the localities but could potentially be used to present more information from one figure. The table is a summary of the living pool of molluscan species from the Californian region. It shows higher percentages of genera and families from the living pool that were found as fossils compared to percentages of species. In fact, almost 90% of the families appear in the record.
