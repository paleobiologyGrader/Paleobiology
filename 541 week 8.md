Determinants of extinction in the fossil record
 
## Article Summary

This paper by Shanan E. Peters and Michael Foote is a scientific paper on the determinants of extinction in the fossil record.


assessing the fossil record quality, in particular, on marine benthic communities. He also discussed the life and death assemblages and its comparison to Pleistocene assemblages. The durably skeletonized species that inhabit the environments where they are found is reflected in the composition of the dead assemblages. In some cases, fine spatial gradients and variations in living associations are represented in the dead assemblages. Valentine found that the record captured all of the important species and species associations, and a very high percentage of all species in the families studied. A quite complete record of the easily fossilized fraction of the living fauna has been formed from the species-rich accumulations of dead shells over a wide range of shelf environments. The completeness of the species pool also implies that the living communities are well represented. The bulk of the marine invertebrate fossil record the preserved remnants of an excellent original record formed through ordinary though episodic processes. Valentine concludes that the main loss in the numbers of fossilized durably skeletonized species occurs during the destruction of the fossil record rather than during the incorporation of shells into dead assemblages or even of the dead assemblages into lithologic units.
