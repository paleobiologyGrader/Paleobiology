Decoupling of taxonomic and ecologic severity
of Phanerozoic marine mass extinctions
 
## Article Summary

This paper by Mary L. Droser et al. is a scientific paper on the Decoupling of taxonomic and ecologic severity of Phanerozoic marine mass extinctions. They compare the relative ecologic degradation caused by two major mass extinctions using a system of paleoecological levels along with an analysis of large-scale paleoenvironmental patterns of two of
the great evolutionary faunas

 that allows for the ranking of ecological degradation or shifts associated with significant
taxonomic events, along with an analysis of large-scale paleoenvironmental patterns of two of
the great evolutionary faunas, 


to compare the relative ecologic degradation caused by two
major mass extinctions. 

analyses show that whereas the Late Ordovician extinction resulted in only minimal permanent
ecological change, the Late Devonian extinction resulted in the complete restructuring of
many components of the marine ecosystem. Thus, the large-scale taxonomic and ecological significance
of these extinction events are decoupled, implying that some taxa are ecologically
more critical than others.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There is one figure and one table. Figure 1 is the Paleozoic time-environment diagram of Sepkoski and Miller (1985), showing environmental and temporal distribution of Cambrian, Paleozoic, and modern (M) evolutionary faunas. It can be used in viewing the ecological impact of extinctions.  compiling a data matrix consisting of the taxonomic composition, environmental position along an onshore-offshore environmental gradient, and temporal position of 540 communities.the factor analytic study of Sepkoski and Miller (1985) can be used to quantitatively demonstrate the differential ecological severities of the Late Ordovician and Late Devonian mass extinctions. 



 Table 1 shows the definition of paleoecological levels and characteristic signals for each level
