## Article Summary

This paper by Mary L. Droser et al. is a scientific paper on the decoupling of taxonomic and ecologic severity of Phanerozoic marine mass extinctions. They compare the relative ecologic degradation caused by the late Ordovican (ca. 440 Ma) and the late Devonian (ca. 364 Ma) mass extinctions using a system of paleoecological levels along with an analysis of large-scale paleoenvironmental patterns of two of the great evolutionary faunas. There are four paleoecological levels. The first level is the most severe and represents the emergence of new ecosystems. The second level refers to changes within an established ecosystem and represents major structural change at a large ecological scale. Third level changes include the appearance and disappearance of community types in established ecological structures. Lastly, the fourth level refers to changes in the presence of paleocommunities. Droser et al. found that the Late Ordovician mass extinction had only third- and fourth-level paleoecological changes whereas the Late Devonian mass extinction had second-, third-, and fourth-level changes. The analyses show minor permanent ecological changes over the late Ordovician mass extinction in contrast to the severe restructuring of the marine ecosystems of the Late Devonian mass extinction. However, the Late Ordovician extinction had a slightly greater taxonomic loss than the Devonian. As a result, the taxonomic and ecologic severity of the two events can be decoupled and imply that the ecological severity of some taxa is higher than others.

## Things I liked about the paper

I agree with the paper that the ecological impact of mass extinction can be separated from its taxonomic impact. In this particular case, the ecological sytems after the late Devonian extinction was a stark contrast to before even though it had lower taxonomic losses than the late Ordovician extinction. Therefore, ecologic and taxonomic severity do not have to both be high or both be low and a high ecologic severity does not necessarily mean a high taxonomic and vice versa. I also think the sections on the late Ordovician and late Devonian mass extinctions was clearly written, well explained, and interesting. In particular, I was actually quite impressed by how quickly the reef, pelagic, and benthic systems recovered after the late Ordovician mass extinction despite the severity of taxonomic loss during this time. In addition, I also found the importance of the stromatoporoids to reefal niches and in particular, to the growth of tabulate corals, very interesting. Also, how this impacts the failure of some ecosystems to recover after the late Devonian because of the absence of the three-dimensional physical structure provided by the stromatoporoids.

## Things I did not like about the paper

I would have like a bit more figures in the overall paper. In particular, maybe one to illustrate the comparison in taxonomic loss between the Late Ordovician and Late Devonian mass extinctions. Also, maybe another figure to compare the relative diversity of species before and after each mass extinction, to accompany the elaborations on their ecological changes. 

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There is one figure and one table. Figure 1 is the Paleozoic time-environment diagram of Sepkoski and Miller (1985), showing environmental and temporal distribution of Cambrian, Paleozoic, and modern (M) evolutionary faunas. It is a compilation of a data matrix consisting of taxonomic composition, environmental position along an onshore-offshore environmental gradient, and temporal position of 540 communities and can be used in viewing the ecological impact of extinctions. Table 1 shows the definition of paleoecological levels and characteristic signals for each level.
