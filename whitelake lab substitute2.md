The Newest Synthesis: Understanding the Interplay of Evolutionary and Ecological Dynamics
 
## Article Summary

This paper by Schoener is a review on the relationship between evolution and ecological communities. Reznick et al. show rapid evolution in various traits in nature, and especially within areas with the influence of human predatory activities. In principle, rapid rates of evolution can mean a possibility of evolutionary dynamics affecting ecology or a feedback loop interaction instead of only ecology affecting evolution. Ecological and evolutionary correspondence was not recognized and perhaps due to low influence of fitness gains to the equilibrium population size and the inconsistency of the rate of evolution in paleontological records to rapid evolution in more recent studies. Recent reviews show that ecological communities can be impacted by genetic variation.


## Things I liked about the paper
      
I think I can agree or am convinced that evolution and ecology interact with each other in a feedback loop. The process is continuous and further adaptation can change their interaction with other organisms that can change the ecology of their habitat which would in turn cause them to continue to evolve.

## Things I did not like about the paper

I do not really understand the part on Hairston's analysis on "evolutionary contribution" and "ecological contribution". How was it quantified when they said that the copecod has one-fourth the ecological contribution compared to the finch? They calculated a factor, but how do you assess and quantify the contributions?

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There are four figures in this paper. Figure 1 shows evolutionary and ecological trait dynamic in G. fortis and the yearly ecological and evolutionary contributions to the total rate of change in population growth rate. Figure 2 shows ungulate species population in Ezard et al.â€™s (18) study and the mean absolute change of environment and phenotype with 95% parametric confidence intervals. The change quantifies the effects on population growth of environmental and phenotypic changes. Figure 3 shows the relation between rate of phenotypic evolution and number of generations. There is a decrease in variance of the phenotypic evolution rates with the length of the observation period. Figure 4 shows the method of studying Caribbean lizards' eco-evolutionary dynamics. Smaller Anolis sagrei is found on the ground and trunks of trees prior to the introduction of the lizard Leiocephalus carinatus, which is a large predator. Its introduction may have resulted in decreaseing size of population and habitat changeof the A. sagrei. A change in selection pressures may have triggered rapid evolution of A. sagrei and could affect the local ecology by altering arthropod densities and distributions and by increasing population size of A. sagrei
