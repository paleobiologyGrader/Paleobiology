## Article Summary

This paper by Gingerich 
In the Paleocene-Eocene epoch transition, there is an unusual and sudden clustering of Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla and Primates. In addition, these modern orders have early species that are much smaller than their immediate descendants without much explanation prior to the use stable isotopes. Based on abrupt decrease in d18O, in foraminifera carbonate tests, a short 100 000-year warming event was identified as the PETM. Later on, the Paleocene-Eocene boundary became defined by the carbon isotope excursions from the Clarks Fork-Bighorn basins. The study of the PETM is important in considering the causes and effects of global greenhouse warming, and the predictions for today's global warming. In particular, it could start a runaway feedback warming like in the Eocene transition and even cause dwarfing in mammals as a result of methane oxidation. The PETM and associated CIE represent one of many episodic environmental perturbations, that can be explained by Stenseth and Smith's Stationary hyphothesis of episodic evolution. Gingerich thus concluded that global environmental events must be considered in modelling the history of life as they greatly affect evolution in the past. 

## Things I liked about the paper
      
I like that the author put in a lot of background information into the paper which made understanding the topic as a whole easier.
The distribution of tooth sizes through time in Figure 4 was very interesting. I thought that the figure made me convinced of the size change, relating to the dwarfism during the PETM.

## Things I did not like about the paper

While I did like all the background information that the author elaborated on in the paper, it made it more lengthy and a task to get through the paper and find the main points of his research. It is, however, still quite straightforward and written not too complicatedly so it was not too bad.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There are four figures in this paper. Figure 1 shows the stratigraphic context of Paleocene–Eocene vertebrate faunal change. The coincidence of size trend with the carbon isotope excursions accentuated the importance of the CIE in detecting global channge. Figure 2 shows the Global distribution of fossil localities contributing to our understanding of environmental and evolutionary change at the Paleocene–Eocene boundary. Figure 3 shows the High-resolution stratigraphic record of benthic marine foraminiferal species studied in relation to carbon isotope d13C during the onset of the Paleocene–Eocene CIE. Figure 4 shows size change and apparent dwarfing in the mammalian genus Ectocion evolving across the Paleocene–Eocene boundary.
