## Article Summary

Payne and Finnegan study the effect of geographic range on extinction risk during background and mass extinction. Even with species richness and occurence frequency controls, they find that range is strongly associated with survivorship, confirming geographic range as an important determinant of extinction risk in the marine environment during the Phanerozoic. 

According to Payne and Finnegan, geological and geochemical evidence of widespread disturbance during intervals of mass extinctions are disproportionately represented. They suggest that deviations in expected selectivity is likely a result of the simultaneous application of similar ecological and/or physiological stresses on most geographic regions or a result of population size differences. This is supported by strong ecological and/or physiological selectivity in previous studies that link mass extinctions to widespread environmental disturbances. Payne and Finnegan also interpreted their results as evidence that background and mass extinction differ in the geographic scale of the main processes that cause extinction.They do state that other factors may certainly affect extinction risk through many intervals, but that geographic range is the most consistent predictor of this in the marine environment. 

Their analyses are based on occurence data of all Phenerozoic marine invertebrates downloaded from the PBDB on August 16, 2006. They further reduced the scope of the analyses to benthic taxa to avoid misinterpretation and contradicting results since pelagic/nektonic organisms are often subject to fundamentally different biogeographic and taphonomic regimes. They used tectonic plates as a measurement for geographic rnage because they are likely associated with biogeoghraphic boundaries throughout the Phenerozoic and to avoid the uncertainties of paleolatitude and paleolongitude for older time intervals. They used binary logistic regression to evaluate selectivity of survivorship and determined the statistical significance of each analysis by the degree to which the odds ratio differed from 1. They also used data from the Exxon sea-level curve and Peters and Foote for testing correlations between geographic range selectivity and changes sea level and sedimentary rock volume. 

## Things I liked about the paper
      
I like their assumptions of observed differences in geographic range imperfectly reflecting actual differences.
They address that incompleteness of the fossil record would affect analyses that depend on absolute measures of diversity or geographic range but that it does not severely impair their goal to examine the whether extinction is more likely with widespread genera or narrowly distributed genera. It keeps their argument strong while avoiding attacks on the perfectness that can be impaired as a result of incompleteness of the fossil record.

## Things I did not like about the paper

It is not that I do not like this part, but I was actually wondering about the part when they said that they used the natural logarithm of the odds ratio so that the effect strength is symmetrical. Why is this symmetry important and/or useful? I do not really understand what it does.

> Hopefull our lab on odds ratios helped clear this up for you.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

Figure 1 shows the trends in geographic range selectivity of genus survivorship during the Phanerozoic. The trends from multiple regression is similar to trends of a single regression so geographic range selectivity is not simply a result of correlation with species richness and number of global occurences. Figure 2 is a plot of range selectivity versus extinction intensity. It shows an inverse correlation because extinction risk is more sensitive to geogrphic range during intervals of low per-plate extinction intensities. Figure 3 shows the observed geographic range selectivity against the expected selectivity measured as log-odds if extinctions were entirely independent across plates. The figures in this paper plot the natural logarithm of the odds ratio so that effect strength is symmetrical with both positive and inverse associations.
