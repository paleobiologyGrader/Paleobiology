The effect of geographic range on extinction risk during background and mass extinction
 
## Article Summary

This paper by Payne and Finnegan 

Our results show that wide geographic range has been significantly and positively associated with survivorship for the great majority of Phanerozoic time. Moreover, the significant association between geographic range and survivorship remains after controlling for differences in species richness and abundance among genera. 

However, mass extinctions and several second-order extinction events exhibit less geographic range selectivity than predicted by range alone. Widespread environmental disturbance can explain the reduced association between geographic range and extinction risk by simultaneously affecting genera with similar ecological and physiological characteristics on global scales. Although factors other than geographic range have certainly affected extinction risk during many intervals, geographic range is likely the most consistently significant predictor of extinction risk in the marine fossil record.



## Things I liked about the paper
      
I like the use of color in this paper as it makes it more visually pleasing specifically in the figures.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

Figure 1 shows the trends in geographic range selectivity of genus survivorship during the Phanerozoic. Figure 2 is a plot of range selectivity versus extinction intensity. Figure 3 shows the observed geographic range selectivity against the expected selectivity measured as log-odds if extinctions were entirely independent across plates.
