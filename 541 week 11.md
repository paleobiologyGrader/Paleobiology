## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

Figure 1 shows the trends in geographic range selectivity of genus survivorship during the Phanerozoic. Figure 2 is a plot of range selectivity versus extinction intensity. Figure 3 shows the observed geographic range selectivity against the expected selectivity measured as log-odds if extinctions were entirely independent across plates.
