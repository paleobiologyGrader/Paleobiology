The Red Queen and the Court Jester: Species Diversity and the Role of Biotic and Abiotic Factors Through Time
 
## Article Summary

This paper discusses species diversity and clade dynamics with respect to biotic and abiotic factors through time. Benton uses the Red Queen model to examine biotic pressures, particularly competition and the Court Jester model, which is that evolution, speciation, and extinction only really happens in response to physical environment changes. He exlores largest-scale global, taxic investigations and explain how they relate to Red Queen, Court
Jester, and multilevel mixed model predictions. He also describes some phylogenetic studies of the species diversity macroevolution. 

According to Benton, species richness through time may correlate with energy from evapo-transpiration, temperature, or productivity. He also says that species diversity increase can be due to occupation of new ecospace, increased specialization and niche subdivision. According to him, drivers and controls on speciation can be understood through the study of species as member of clades. That is, ideally, through a complete species tree, which is quite an impossible endeavor. Further diversification shift identifications allow better application of the Red Queen and Court Jester models. If the shifts are found to be more coordinated, and correlate with abiotic changes, then the macroevolution Court Jester model will be more useful. On the other hand, if the shifts are constrained to certain clades and not temporally coordinated with other clades, then the Red Queen model may be considered.


## Things I like about the paper

I think the figures are very well presented, particularly figure 3 with the colors and dinosaur illustrations. The phylgenic relationships can be easily seen from this figure. I also like that they elaborate on the limitations and difficulties in using the models and in making the analyses so that we understand how the results can be affected or can become inaccurate.

## Things I did not like about the paper

Did I just not understand the paper or is there actually not really a conclusion by the end of it? I do not really favor the models and the use of clade trees as an approach to studying species diversity. Especially with the uncertainties that go into building clade trees and with even more uncertainties as a result of missing species in the fossil record.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

Figure 1 shows the operation of Red Queen (biotic causation) and Court Jester (abiotic causation) models subject to different temporal scales. The divergence between the two models depend on scale. Figure 2 plots marine genus diversification through the Phanerozoic. It compares current estimates from the empirical Sepkoski database and the Paleobiology Database that has been standardized in sampling. Figure 3 shows the phylogenetic relationships and morphospace occupation for Triassic archosaurs. It show expansion and extinction of seven species and their phylogenetic relationships to one another.
