The Red Queen and the Court Jester: Species Diversity and the ROle of Biotic and Abiotic Factors Through Time
 
## Article Summary

This paper discusses species diversity and clade dynamics with respect to biotic and abiotic factors through time. Benton uses the Red Queen model to examine biotic pressures, particularly competition and the Court Jester model, which is that evolution, speciation, and extinction only really happens in response to physical environment changes. He exlores largest-scale global, taxic investigations and explain how they relate to Red Queen, Court
Jester, and multilevel mixed model predictions. He also describes some phylogenetic studies of the species diversity macroevolution.

Figure 1 shows the operation of Red Queen (biotic causation) and Court Jester (abiotic causation) models subject to different temporal scales. Figure 2 plots marine genus diversification through the Phanerozoic. Figure 3 shows the phylogenetic relationships and morphospace occupation for Triassic archosaurs.
