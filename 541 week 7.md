The Influence of Lithification on Cenozoic Marine Biodiversity Trends
 
## Article Summary

This paper by Austin J. W. Hendy is a scientific paper on 

Analyses presented here on the Cenozoic fossil record of New Zealand demonstrate that unlithified sediments not only increase the amount of fossil material and hence the observed diversity therein, but they also preserve a pool of taxa that is compositionally distinct from lithified sediments. The
implication is that a large component of the difference in estimates of within-community diversity between Paleozoic and Cenozoic assemblages may relate to the increased availability of unlithified sediments in the Cenozoic. 

He presents comparisons of the diversity of mollusc- and brachiopod-dominated fossil assemblages at a range of spatial scales and with
environmental constraints to demonstrate not only the effect of lithification on the availability of fossil material, but also its effect on taxonomic composition, a bias not mitigated through sampling-standardization techniques.

small decrease in the proportion of taxa (and occurences) with predominantly aragonitic skeletons in lithified sediment.

concludes 
lithified assemblages will generally not yield the diversity of unlithified assemblages at comparable or even significantly larger sample sizes; instead, there are fundamental differences in the composition and abundance structure from assemblages of unlithified versus lithified sediments, which likely relate to variation in preservation potential within an assemblage. 

he results of this study suggest that a significant part of
the increase, perhaps as much as half of it, may be attributable to the increasing availability of unlithified sediments through the Cenozoic Era. Macroevolutionary trends in the structure of marine communities (e.g., increased ecospace utilization and evolutionary escalation) are likely explanations for any remaining observed increase in within-community diversity through the Phanerozoic, after consideration of lithification, diagenetic, environmental, and latitudinal biases.
