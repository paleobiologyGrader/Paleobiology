The Influence of Lithification on Cenozoic Marine Biodiversity Trends
 
## Article Summary

This paper by Austin J. W. Hendy is a scientific paper on 

Analyses presented here on the Cenozoic fossil record of New Zealand demonstrate that unlithified sediments not only increase the amount of fossil material and hence the observed diversity therein, but they also preserve a pool of taxa that is compositionally distinct from lithified sediments. The
implication is that a large component of the difference in estimates of within-community diversity between Paleozoic and Cenozoic assemblages may relate to the increased availability of unlithified sediments in the Cenozoic. 

He presents comparisons of the diversity of mollusc- and brachiopod-dominated fossil assemblages at a range of spatial scales and with
environmental constraints to demonstrate not only the effect of lithification on the availability of fossil material, but also its effect on taxonomic composition, a bias not mitigated through sampling-standardization techniques.

although longer faunal lists might reflect greater diversity they might also reflect increased sampling effort, ease of sampling, or repeated collecting.
small decrease in the proportion of taxa (and occurences) with predominantly aragonitic skeletons in lithified sediment.

concludes 
lithified assemblages will generally not yield the diversity of unlithified assemblages at comparable or even significantly larger sample sizes; instead, there are fundamental differences in the composition and abundance structure from assemblages of unlithified versus lithified sediments, which likely relate to variation in preservation potential within an assemblage. 

he results of this study suggest that a significant part of
the increase, perhaps as much as half of it, may be attributable to the increasing availability of unlithified sediments through the Cenozoic Era. Macroevolutionary trends in the structure of marine communities (e.g., increased ecospace utilization and evolutionary escalation) are likely explanations for any remaining observed increase in within-community diversity through the Phanerozoic, after consideration of lithification, diagenetic, environmental, and latitudinal biases.

## Things I did not like about the paper

I would like some more figures in the paper because it is quite boringly represented. I would have liked to see some stratigraphic columns to represent some of the data from some of the localities. I also think that the map in Figure 1 could hold more data to add more depth and significance to it. It currently only shows the localities mapped on a map without any more additional information.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There are five figures and a table in this paper. 

and they are both fairly simple. The figure is a map of the main localities studied in the paper. It helps to show the relative positions of the localities but could potentially be used to present more information from one figure. The table is a summary of the living pool of molluscan species from the Californian region. It shows higher percentages of genera and families from the living pool that were found as fossils compared to percentages of species. In fact, almost 90% of the families appear in the record.
