## Article Summary

<strike>This paper by Austin J. W. Hendy is a scientific paper on the influence of lithification on Cenozoic marine biodiversity.</strike> Hendy shows that unlithified sediments increase the amount of fossil material and increase preservation of taxa that is distinct from lithified sediment compositions. In this paper, he demonstrates the effect of lithification on the availability of fossil material and its effect on taxonomic composition by comparing the diversity of mollusc- and brachiopod-dominated fossil assemblages at a range of spatial scales and with environmental constraints. The primary data set used is of 169 fossil samples that range from the late Miocene to Pleistocene and was collected from the Wanganui and East Coast sedimentary basins of New Zealand.

> Was that the only data he used?

The sampling was restricted to mollusc- or brachiopod-dominated transgressive shell bed facies to keep the environment conditions relatively consistent and control between-sample variation in time-averaging. Furthermore, to provide a base line for comparing the influence of lithification state on occurance data and the abundance data, Hendy also extracted an additional data set from the New Zealand Fossil Record File database (FRF). In conclusion, composition and abundance structure are fundamentally different from the assemblages of unlithified versus lithified sediments that is likely related to preservation potential variations within an assemblage. He found that lithified assemblages at comparable or even significantly larger sample sizes generally do not yield the diversity of unlithified assemblages.


## Things I liked about the paper
      
The paper is not too difficult to understand and follow through to the end. The figures are mostly simple and relevant to what Hendy was elaborating on. I think I can agree that the lithification of sediments can affect the biodiversity count. I also do agree that the results can be extremely biased as a result of the sampling methods and the availability of fossil-bearing sediments. 

## Things I did not like about the paper

I do not really understand how to look at Figures 3 and 4, about the rarefaction of census counts from bulk samples and the means of individual curves. Besides that, the bias from sampling makes me not too sure about the conclusion. But in general, the paper does seems fairly convincing to me.

> Awesome! It's always important to be open about things we don't understand. What exactly about these figures did you not understand? Try to put in words what you *think* the figures show, and why you suspect it is wrong. That way it is easier for me to help you.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There are five figures and a table in this paper. The first figure is a graph of variation in global Phanerozoic marine invertebrate biodiversity and a graph of variation in proportion of collections derived from unlithified and non-lithified sediments through the Phanerozoic. It is used to present previous studies in the biodiversity variations and to compare them to Hendy's current study in the diversity of mollusc- and brachiopod-dominated fossil assemblages. The second figure shows the effect of lithification on an occurance-based data set (FRF). It illustrates the effect of lithification on the richness and is accompanied by Table 1 which shows the genus richness in the sediments. As explained by Hendy, the fourfold increase in the mean genus richness through the late Neogene occurs concurrently with a decrease in the lithification of collections and may not be a reflection in biodiversity trend but rather as a result of sampling methods. Figure 3 and 4 are rarefaction of census counts from bulk samples and the means of individual curves. I do not completely understand the four graphs but it compares the richness in different lithifications of sediments. Figure 5 are graphs of compositions of aragonitic and calcitic skeletal type and compositions of size classes to lithification grade. It is quite simple to look at and show that skeletal size and mineralogy can affect the taxonomic content.
