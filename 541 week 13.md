Dinosaurs in decline tens of millions of years before
their final extinction
 
## Article Summary

This paper by Sakamoto, Benton, and Venditti found a long-term decline throughout all dinosaurs and in all of the dinosaurian subclades. They found decreasing rates of speciation until it decreased even lower than the extinction rate tens of millions of years prior to the K-Pg boundary. This is with an exception to morphologically speciallized herbivors that show increased speciation rates. Their research show high vulnerability of dinosaurs to extinction due to their low ability to replace extinct species and thus a low recovery response from catastrophic events. They used three recent large comprehensive dinosaur phylogenies and scaled the trees using first appearance dates and the last appearance dates. They also used the MCMCglmm R package to place a phylogenetic generalized linear mixed model (GLMMs) in a Bayesian framework. The assessment of the model fit was done using deviance information criterion (DIC) and by inspecting the significance of the model parameter. 

## Things I liked about the paper
      
The first thing I noticed were the very attractive figures. They were clear and made good use of color and illustration.  

## Things I did not like about the paper

I am still not confident in how accurate the models may be compared to what actually happened and how we could eliminated more uncertainties, although I think that this study did assess a lot of other variables such as geographical influences, cladewise lineage diversity, and speciation dynamics within various dinosaurian subclades. I guess that is just the inherent faulty in models, and I am not a completely big fan of statistical models but I do admit that they can do wonders and make very good predictions.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

Figure 1 is a graph of theoretical models of speciation through time. Figure 2 are model temporal predictions of speciation in Mesozoic dinosaurs. Figure 3 shows net speciation per 1 My through time in Mesozoic dinosaurs.
