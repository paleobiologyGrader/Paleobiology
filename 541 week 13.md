Dinosaurs in decline tens of millions of years before
their final extinction
 
## Article Summary

This paper by Sakamoto, Benton, and Venditti found a long-term decline throughout all dinosaurs and in all of the dinosaurian subclades. They found decreasing rates of speciation until it decreased even lower than the extinction rate tens of millions of years prior to the K-Pg boundary. This is with an exception to morphologically speciallized herbivors that show increased speciation rates. Their research show high vulnerability of dinosaurs to extinction due to their low ability to replace extinct species and thus a low recovery response from catastrophic events.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

Figure 1 is a graph of theoretical models of speciation through time. Figure 2 are model temporal predictions of speciation in Mesozoic dinosaurs. Figure 3 shows net speciation per 1 My through time in Mesozoic dinosaurs.
