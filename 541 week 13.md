## Article Summary

This paper by Barnosky 


Our results show that wide geographic range has been significantly and positively associated with survivorship for the great majority of Phanerozoic time. Moreover, the significant association between geographic range and survivorship remains after controlling for differences in species richness and abundance among genera. 

However, mass extinctions and several second-order extinction events exhibit less geographic range selectivity than predicted by range alone. Widespread environmental disturbance can explain the reduced association between geographic range and extinction risk by simultaneously affecting genera with similar ecological and physiological characteristics on global scales. Although factors other than geographic range have certainly affected extinction risk during many intervals, geographic range is likely the most consistently significant predictor of extinction risk in the marine fossil record.


## Things I liked about the paper
      
I like the use of color in this paper as it makes it more visually pleasing specifically in the figures.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There are three figures in this paper. Figure 1 shows the relationship between extinction rates and the time interval over which the rates were calculated, for mammals. Figure 2 shows the extinction magnitudes of IUCN-assessed taxa in comparison to the 75% mass-extinction benchmark. Figure 3 shows the extinction rate versus extinction magnitude.
