Dinosaurs in decline tens of millions of years before
their final extinction
 
## Article Summary

This paper by Sakamoto, Benton, and Venditti found a long-term decline throughout all dinosaurs and in all of the dinosaurian subclades. They found decreasing rates of speciation until it decreased even lower than the extinction rate tens of millions of years prior to the K-Pg boundary. This is with an exception to morphologically speciallized herbivors that show increased speciation rates. Their research show high vulnerability of dinosaurs to extinction due to their low ability to replace extinct species and thus a low recovery response from catastrophic events. They used three recent large comprehensive dinosaur phylogenies and scaled the trees using first appearance dates and the last appearance dates. They also used the MCMCglmm R package to place a phylogenetic generalized linear mixed model (GLMMs) in a Bayesian framework. The assessment of the model fit was done using deviance information criterion (DIC) and by inspecting the significance of the model parameter. 

## Things I liked about the paper
      
I like that they tried to resolve previous disputes on dinosaur declines through a more rigorous statistical model that considered phylogenetic and the impact of time. They made a good point on how the number speciation events in each phylogenetic tree path is affected by relatives changes in speciation and extinction rates, and why it would be important to consider time and phylogeny in this study. Also, the first thing I noticed were the very attractive figures. I particularly liked that they were clear and made good use of color and illustration.  

## Things I did not like about the paper

I am still not confident in how accurate theoretical models in general may be compared to what actually happened and how we could eliminated more uncertainties, although I think that this study did assess a lot of other variables such as geographical influences, cladewise lineage diversity, and speciation dynamics within various dinosaurian subclades. It is a much better attempt than previous studies that were only based on tabulated data, that cannot account for the phylogenentic and temporal nonindependence. I guess that is just the inherent faulty in models, and I am not a completely big fan of statistical models but I do admit that they can do wonders and make very good predictions.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

Figure 1 is a graph of theoretical models of speciation through time. Acording to this figure, it is important to consider time and phylogeny in studying the dinosaurian decline. It shows how the number speciation events in each phylogenetic tree path is affected by relatives changes in speciation and extinction rates. Figure 2 are model temporal predictions of speciation in Mesozoic dinosaurs. They include various types od dinosaurs and assessspeciation dynamics in the different dinosaurian subclades. Figure 3 shows net speciation per 1 My through time in Mesozoic dinosaurs. It shows the onset of speciation slowdown in therepods earlier on in the Late Triassic eventhough some of Theropoda has one of the highest diversity in morphology among the dinosarian clades, suggesting an adaptive radiation-type speciation.
